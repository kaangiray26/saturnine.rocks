title: Visiting Plini
---

It was a rainy wednesday in Aachen when I realized that I had forgotten our tickets at home. We were inside the train and immediately got out of it. In 8 minutes, I rushed back home, grabbed the tickets and caught the next train. And so, we were on our way to Oberhausen, Kulttempel, to see Plini live for the first time.

I heard them for the first time a couple years ago, a very good friend of mine made me listen to their **Selenium Forest** and I thought, *"yeah, this sounds good"*, and then totally forgot about them.

But then, just spontaneously, we bought the tickets with another good friend of mine to see them. And from the first minute we stepped into the room, it was a blast. And I'm not even talking about Plini yet. There were two bands before them, **[Yomi Ship](https://open.spotify.com/artist/15tGSRQIcaaUae1tuZsuL5?si=EUWC2tbNQCG1DtRv_apJBQ)**, and **[Night Verses](https://open.spotify.com/artist/55GUoQ2E2hze3842bFs4bb?si=Nq-zqVlcTOOHxHPZHmD0Gw)**, which was quite a surprise for me. I did listen to Night Verses before but never heard of Yomi Ship. And they hooked me right away.

I guess Yomi Ship was playing some songs from their latest album **[Feast Eternal](https://open.spotify.com/album/0TPqXqIVlBUq2QP74atpj7?si=Ccl5TkcgQaGQAYDRRcD74Q)**. They have this atmospheric, psychedelic-like tunes that I really enjoyed. And Night Verses, well, they were just insanely energetic. Their drummer was jumping in the air, without his shirt on, and playing the drums like a madman. I wished I was a bit earlier to see their whole set.

And then came Plini.

Their performance was amazing. The music really got me, I was literally ascending to another dimension, and no, I don't do drugs. Plini and his band got the first song wrong, but they laughed it off and replayed it I believe. They were so chill and relaxed. I joked about them to my friend saying, *"He has the calmnest and self-assurance of a professor from RWTH Aachen, giving the same lecture for the 100th time"*.

Oh, and they were really funny. At some point, I think they got hungry and the guitar player started eating something with a spoon, while the other band members were looking at him with eye contact, playing some notes. It was hilarious. Everytime Plini talked, the drummer was doing some beats with his drumsticks, like a talk show. It was a really good vibe.

Most of the songs were from their **[Mirage](https://open.spotify.com/album/5ZelHaf1LMhBIPlN26mVFJ?si=ICQKjJuJTa6SLKvFH9O6yw)** EP, and if you have time for one more song, I'd recommend you to listen to Ember.

I'm really glad I saw them live, even though we had to wander around the streets of DÃ¼sseldorf until 4 am to catch the first train back to Aachen. It was definitely worth it. I hope to see them again soon. Lots of love to Plini and Australia.
