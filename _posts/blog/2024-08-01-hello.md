Hey there! I am [kaangiray26](https://www.buzl.uk/), and welcome to my blog!

This is just a small music blog I've been wanting to start for a long time. We would always talk about music with friends and share with each other the strange music we found, but in the end, we would always forget about it. So, I decided to record all of it here.

Well, I'm not a musician, last time I've played an instrument was middle school, but I've always appreciated good quality music. You want to summarize this blog in one sentence? It's all about the melancholic, sad, and emotional music that will make you really feel something.

I hope you enjoy it!
